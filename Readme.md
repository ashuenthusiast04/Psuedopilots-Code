# *SETUP OF THE ENVIRONMENT*

We will be having a mobile camera(in this case we are using the open-source DroidCam Client connected through common wifi network between mobile device and laptop) mounted on the top of the arena (here on the stair of a ladder) which will be taking live feed of the dynamic environment of the arena and feed each frames to the path algorithm code. In each frames, we will be having some obstacles in the arena and two arucos, one representing the robot and the other representing the stack.
